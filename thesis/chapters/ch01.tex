    "Quantum mechanics is the description of the behavior of matter and light in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen."  Richard P. Feynman \cite{Feynman_Leighton_Sands_1966}

\begin{displayquote}
"A quantum computer (Deutsch 1985) is one in which quantum-mechanical interference can be harnessed to perform computations. Such a computation also need not necessarily evaluate functions when it is solving problems, because the state of its output might be a coherent superposition of states corresponding to different answers, each of which solves the problem. This allows quantum computers to solve problems by methods which are not available to any classical device." David Deutsch and Richard Jozsa \cite{deutsch1992rapid}
